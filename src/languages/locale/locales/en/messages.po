In the event of any controversy or dispute between SendAfrika and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the application, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed sixty (60) days), then either party may submit a dispute arising out of or relating to these terms of use for arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Ghanaian Alternative Dispute Resolution Act. Arbitration shall take place in Accra, Greater-Accra, and shall be conducted in the English language. Provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall restrict or limit the right of either party to seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction."
